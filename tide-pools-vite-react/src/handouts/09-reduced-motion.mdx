## 🛠 Hands-On (~15 minutes)  
- Add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` styles.  
- Replace animations with fades or instant transitions.  
- Provide a toggle to disable motion manually.  

## ✅ Verify (~5 minutes)  
- With reduced motion OS setting, no movement occurs.  
- Toggle works even without OS preference.
