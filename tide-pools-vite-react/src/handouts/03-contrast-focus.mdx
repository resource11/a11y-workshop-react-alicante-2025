⏱ ~25 minutes  
📖 EAA Category: Perceivable & Operable  

📂 Repo Reminder:

- Handout: handouts/exercises/03-contrast-focus.mdx  
- Storybook: Exercises/03 – Contrast & Focus  

## 🎧 Screen Reader Pause (~5 minutes)  
Explore visually and with keyboard. Problems you’ll see:  
- Low-contrast buttons (light gray on white).  
- Focus ring removed with CSS.  

## 🛠 Hands-On (~15 minutes)  
- Use accessible color contrast (WCAG 2.2 min: 4.5:1 for normal text).  
- Reinstate visible focus styles — don’t use `outline: none`.  
- Use custom focus styles that meet WCAG (2px solid with sufficient contrast).  

## ✅ Verify (~5 minutes)  
- Check contrast using a color contrast tool.  
- Tab through — is focus visible everywhere?  
- Confirm screen reader announces focus changes.
