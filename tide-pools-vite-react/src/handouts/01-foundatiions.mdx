## 🎧 Screen Reader Pause (~5 minutes)  
Explore the broken page with VoiceOver or NVDA. Notice:  
- Headings are just `<div>`s styled visually.  
- Some heading levels are skipped.  
- Interactive items use `role="button"` or `role="link"` instead of semantic elements.  

## 🛠 Hands-On (~10 minutes)  
- Replace `<div>`-based headings with `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.  
- Ensure heading levels are sequential (no skipped levels).  
- Replace fake “buttons” and “links” with `<button>` and `<a>`.  
- Add a `<main>` landmark for structure.  

## ✅ Verify (~5 minutes)  
- Navigate headings with your screen reader.  
- Tab through interactive elements.  
- Ensure buttons and links announce correctly.
